**oEmbed Manager** is a WordPress plugin to manage oEmbed capabilities of your website and to take a new step in the GDPR compliance of your embedded content.

It helps you to:
- allow/disallow other websites to embed your content;
- conditionally allow/disallow the display of embedded content on your site;
- fine tune the way oEmbed operates in the WordPress core;
- list, clear and update/create oEmbed cached items.

To conditionally allow/disallow the display of embedded content, **oEmbed Manager** fully integrates with:

- [Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/uk-cookie-consent/)
- [Cookie Notice for GDPR](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-notice/)
- [Do Not Track Stats](https://github.com/Pierre-Lannoy/wp-do-not-track-stats)
- [EU Cookie Law](https://wordpress.org/plugins/eu-cookie-law/)
- [GDPR](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gdpr/)
