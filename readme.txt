Manage oEmbed capabilities of your website and take a new step in the GDPR compliance of your embedded content.

== Description ==

**oEmbed Manager**  helps you to:

* allow/disallow other websites to embed your content;
* conditionally allow/disallow the display of embedded content on your site;
* fine tune the way oEmbed operates in the WordPress core;
* list, clear and update/create oEmbed cached items.

To conditionally allow/disallow the display of embedded content, **oEmbed Manager**  fully integrates with:

* [Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/uk-cookie-consent/)
* [Cookie Notice for GDPR](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-notice/)
* [Do Not Track Stats](https://wordpress.org/plugins/do-not-track-stats/)
* [EU Cookie Law](https://wordpress.org/plugins/eu-cookie-law/)
* [GDPR](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gdpr/)
* [GDPR Cookie Compliance](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gdpr-cookie-compliance/)
* [GDPR Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-law-info/)

If you use one of these plugins, you can set oEmbed to display embedded content only when a visitor has agreed your cookie or privacy policy, or when she/he has not set the Do Not Track flag of her/his browser.
